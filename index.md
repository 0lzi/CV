### DataCenter Engineer/IT Infrastructure project engineer (2018-2022)

*Role*

My main role as Datacentre Engineer is to maintain the DCIM of our Datacentre, complete regular backup tape swaps, install network and server equipment and do regular PCI Wireless audits. This accounts for about 10% of the role. The BAU side of being a datacentre engineer is to monitor all site UPS/PDU infrastructure as well as local data cabling and to support the local facility with additional data where required along with improvements and documentation.

The major portion of the role has evolved to include a large percentage of construction projects and being the IT Lead for them. The largest project I have been involved in has been the latest THG ICON Studios and Office space, which is part of THG's $1b development around Manchester Airport which is set to bring in 10,000 employees. My specific involvement was to work with M&E contractors to assist in CAT A design works for ducting, Containment and Power. Then to work closely with M&E contractors and internal THG teams for CAT B design works and requirement gathering as well as co-ordinating fit out, testing and IT infrastructure

The main design elements include:
- Designing Server & Comms rooms
  - Power, Lighting & Construction
- Data & Voice design
- Wireless design
- UPS and Cooling design
- Physical network layout
- Patch schedules
- Fibre Schematics
- IT Specifications of passive infrastructure

With the construction projects we work with RIBA stages 1-6, we work closely with the projects team and contractors, there is a large element of contractor co-ordination and design workshops to ensure our requirements and specifications are met. Snagging is a large part of the construction phase to ensure the specification is being met and best practices are being followed as per specification.

### Warehouse IT (2015-2018)

*Role*

My main role as Warehouse IT engineer was to help maintain the IT infrastructure within the warehouses and to support roughly 2000 users, our team have successfully dilapidated 4 manual warehouses and deployed and kitted out a ~685,500 sq.ft semi-automated warehouse which included a food production site. I managed the MDM platform for 500+ mobile devices and tablets, help deploy and maintain the VDI infrastructure in the warehouse as well as plan and develop improvement projects for the warehouse and operations team, these projects were designed to increase productivity, reduce cost and or help develop the work flow.

During my time as a Warehouse IT engineer, I stepped into a team leader role while our manager was deployed to another department. This involved managing our team’s workload, planning and deploying for production site, as well as handling BAU requests and escalations. During this period out of hours work was vital as the warehouse went 24/7, I had to manage the on-call rota and work outside of contracted hours to ensure up keep of operations.
